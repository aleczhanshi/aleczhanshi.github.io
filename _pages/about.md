**Research Associate**

*Department of Computer Science*  
*University of Texas at Austin*  
*GDC 5.418*

I'm currently a research associate at the University of Texas at Austin, where he also completed his Ph.D degree in 2020, advised by Professor Calvin Lin. During his Ph.D., he has interned at Google and Facebook. Zhan is interested in the interplay between machine learning and computer systems, with a particular focus on ML for systems. His research develops principled data-driven methods for system optimization problems, such as cache optimizations and automatic accelerator design. His prefetching solution demonstrates significant improvements on Googleâ€™s complex hyperscale workloads. He also serve in the program committees in ML for Systems workshop.
