**Research Associate**

*Department of Computer Science*  
*University of Texas at Austin*  
*GDC 5.418*

I'm currently a research associate at the University of Texas at Austin, where I completed my Ph.D degree in 2020 under the supervision of Professor Calvin Lin. I am interested in the interplay between machine learning and computer systems, with a particular focus on ML for systems. My research develops principled data-driven methods for system optimization problems, such as memory optimizations for general-purpose CPUs and design automation / AI-driven EDA for specialized AI accelerators. I serve in the program committees of ML for Systems workshop and serve as a reviewer for IEEE MICRO. During my Ph.D., I have interned at Google (Summer 2018 and 2019) and Facebook (Summer 2020).
